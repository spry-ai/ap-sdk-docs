# Overview

The Spry RTM API is organized around [REST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer). Automated messages arrive at your designated address, whenever an activity is generated. Our API has predictable resource-oriented URLs, accepts form-encoded request bodies, returns JSON-encoded responses, and uses standard HTTP response codes, authentication, and verbs.

For activities in the past, or should you wish to fetch data manually, REST endpoints are also available.

Our API accepts JSON-encoded request bodies (where a body is required) or a standard set of query parameters, returns JSON-encoded responses, and uses standard HTTP response codes and verbs.

See Integrations for a full list of API-based integrations. The Spry RTM API differs for every account as we release new versions and tailor functionality. Log in to see docs customized to your version of the API, with your test key and data.
