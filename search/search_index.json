Automated messages arrive at your designated address, whenever an activity is generated.

For activities in the past, or should you wish to fetch data manually, REST endpoints are also available. Our API accepts JSON-encoded request bodies (where a body is required) or a standard set of query parameters, returns JSON-encoded responses, and uses standard HTTP response codes and verbs.

In general: Codes in the 2xx range indicate success.
